# Hashing-based ANNs

This project implements Hashing-based PQ and FPQ used for image retrieval. 

## Getting started

1. Clone the application

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RepublicHo/AlgoEngineering3022.git
   ```
2. As uploading large files to GitHub is not recommended, it is suggested that you download the training data from 
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). And add this file into `src/main/resources/.` directory. 

3. Please make sure to configure your JDK version to 1.8/17. 

4. Once you've completed the setup, you can run/debug the main function. To test the model, you can experiment with adjusting the amount of training/testing data.
