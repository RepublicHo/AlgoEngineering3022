# Hashing-based ANNs

This project implements Hashing-based PQ and FPQ used for image retrieval. 

## Getting started

1. **Clone the application:** Clone  from the GitHub repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RepublicHo/AlgoEngineering3022.git
   ```
2. **Download training data:** As uploading large files (training file exceeds the limit) to GitHub is not recommended, it is suggested that you download the training data from 
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). And add this file into `src/main/resources/.` directory. 

3. **Configure JDK:** Make sure that you have JDK 1.8 or JDK 17 configured in your system or IDE.

4. **Run/Debug:** Once you've completed the setup, you can compile and run/debug the main method in `src/main/java/Experiment`. You are suggested using IDE like Eclipse or Intellij. To test the model, you can experiment with adjusting the amount of training/testing data.
